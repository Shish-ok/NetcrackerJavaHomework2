### Задачи по первой главе Хорстмана:

Ex2 (Mod) — Write a program that reads an integer angle (which may be positive or negative) and normalizes it to a value between 0 and 359 degrees. Try it first with the % operator, then with floorMod.

Ex6 (Factorial) —  Write a program that computes the factorial n! = 1 × 2 × . . . × n, using BigInteger. Compute the factorial of 1000.

Ex8 (Substrings) — Write a program that reads a string and prints all of its nonempty substrings.

Ex13 (Lottery) — Write a program that prints a lottery combination, picking six distinct numbers between 1 and 49. To pick six distinct numbers, start with an array list filled with 1...49. Pick a random index and remove the element. Repeat six times. Print the result in sorted order.

Ex14 (Matrix) — Write a program that reads a two-dimensional array of integers and determines whether it is a magic square (that is, whether the sum of all rows, all columns, and the diagonals is the same). Accept lines of input that you break up into individual integers, and stop when the user enters a blank line. For example, with the input 16 3 2 13
5 10 11 8 
9 6 7 12 
4 15 14 1
(Blank line)

your program should respond affirmatively.
